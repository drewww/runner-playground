This is a space for playing with runner tech ideas.

My first project is going to be to rebuild the display layer from scratch.

Additional goals:
 - Get to a set of dev tools that I find joyful to work with, especially in a laptop environment.
 - Get a codebase that feels joyful and experimental.
 - Build some common tools that let me try out new ideas faster.
 - Continue to learn what's possible with LLM code generation.
