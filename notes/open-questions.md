 - How should we center glyphs? Different sized characters (especially vertically) don't look consistently centered. On the one hand I like the idea of "smaller" characters looking smaller. In which case they should probably be closer to the "bottom" of the cell. In other words, enforce a bottom padding versus a top padding.
 - Do we want to create "tile groups?" I thought at first we did. But the only case I can think of is moving the vision for an enemy unit. Are there other cases that justify it?
